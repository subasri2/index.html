     <h1>AGRICULTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY</h1>
<p>Agriculture biotechnology also known as agritech is an area of agriculture science involving the use of scientific tools and techiniques ,including genetic engineering ,moleculer markers, molecular diagnostics ,vaccines ,and tissues culture ,to modify living orgainsms : plants ,animals,and microorganism.crop biotechnology is one aspects of agriculture biotechnology which has been greatly developed upon in recent times .disired trait are exportedfrom a particular species of crop to an entirely different species .these transgene crops possess describes characteristics in terms of flavor ,color of flowers ,growth rate, size of harvested products and resistance to diseasesand pests.</p><br>

	<h3> HISTORY</h3><br>

Farmers have mainpulated plants and animals through selective breeding for decades of thousands of years in order to create desired traits.in 20th century,a surge in technology resulted in an increase in agriculture biothechnology through the selection of traits like the increased yield ,pest resistance ,drought resistance ,and herbicide residence .the first food product through biotechnology was sold in 1990 ,and by 2003,7 million framers were utilizing biotech crops .more than 85% of these farmers were located in developing countries.
<h3>CROP MODIFICATION TECHNIQUES</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Traditional breeding</li>
	<li>Mutation</li>
	<li>Polyploidy</li>
    <li>Protoplastfusion</li>
    <li>RNA interference</li>
    <li>Transgenics</li>
    <li>Genome editing</li>
</ul>

	<h3>IMPROVED NUTRITIONAL CONTENT</h3>

Agriculture biotechnology has been used to improve the nutritional content of varity of crops in an efforts to meet the needs of an increasing population .genetic engineering can produce crops with a higher concentration of vitamins.<br>
FOR EXAMPLE : Golden rice contains three genes that allow plants to produce compounds that are converted to vitamin A in the human body .<br>
This nutritionally improved rice is designed to combat the worlds leading cause of blindness- vitamin A deficiency .<br>
Similarly the banana 21 project has workedto improve the nutrition in bananas to combat micronutrient deficiencies in uganda .<br>
By genetically modifying banana 21 has helped foster a solution to micronutrient deficiencies through the vessels of a staple food and major starch source in africa .additionally,crops can be engineered to reduce toxicity or to produce varieties with removed allergens.

	<h3>SAFETY TESTING AND GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS</h3>
Agricultural biotechnology regulation in US falls under three main government agencies :<br>
<ul>
	<li>The Department of Agriculture(USDA),</li>
	<li>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),</li>
	<li>The Food and Drug Administration(FDA).</li>
</ul>
The USDA must approve the release of any new GMOs, EPA controls the regulation of insecticide ,and the FDA evalutes the safety of a particular crop sent to market .on average ,it takes nearly 13 years and $130 million of research and development for a genetically modified organism to come to market .the regulation process takes up to 8 years in the united states .the safety of GMOs has become a topic a debate worldwide , but scientific articels are being conducted to test the saftey if consuming GMOs in addition to the FDAs work . in one such article ,it was concluded that bt rice did not adversely affect digestion and did not induce horizontal gene transfer.
